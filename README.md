# 🔫🤠 Shootout Minecraft Server

This server was created as a personal game jam. It was ported over to Xenon but unfortunately couldn't retain players due to a nonexistent progression system.
The source code is now available as this project has since been abandoned. It features a custom-made gun system (a very basic raycasting system), a dueling system, and queue signs.
Use it however you'd like, just don't reupload it and claim it as your own!

## ⚠️ Word of Warning
I made this a long time ago without full knowledge of Skript, so therefore the code quality isn't very good. Although the game is stable with only few bugs, the 2v2 gamemode was never fully finished and may be buggy.
